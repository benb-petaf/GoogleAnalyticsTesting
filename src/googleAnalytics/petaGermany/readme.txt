Germany needs only add the constants file at ../global/ga_constants.js

All other GA for Germany is handled through Google Tag Manager.

NB: IMG are beginnging to take over Germany;s site developmnt. As part f this we will transition 
to the PETA "standard" configuration. Check to see whether there are GA Base files for the 
.de sitebefore diving into TM.
